Software Engineering Methods and Tools
Methods: The team adopted Agile methodologies to accommodate iterative development
and constant feedback. Agile emphasises flexibility, collaboration, and regular
communication, which suited the team’s structure and project scope. By breaking down the
project into smaller tasks, assigning team members specific roles, and holding regular
reviews, the team was able to adapt swiftly to changes, ensuring that all tasks met their
deadlines while maintaining quality. We considered using the Waterfall model, which
involves taking each section one by one as a group, (i.e. we would all work on requirements,
then all on risk assessment etc), however, this approach felt too stagnant, as it would result
in 7 people all trying to work together on a single document, which would lead to a lot of
clashes and the ability for more disagreements, so as a result, we chose to stick with Agile.
Communication: The team used Instagram group chat for communication due to its
accessibility and familiarity. This choice provided fast response times, vital for maintaining
fluid communication during development. The team considered using Discord, a platform
widely used for collaboration and file sharing, but as most members were more active on
Instagram, this increased efficiency, especially because the file sharing aspect of Discord
wasn’t needed due to our use of other software for file management. The use of Discord had
its benefits though, such as the ability to have multiple different channels if we created a
server, so we could keep all “requirements” stuff in a single tab, but the pure ease of creating
an Instagram group chat deemed it simply more effective for us to create one of those
instead.
File Management: Google Drive was used to organise files for each aspect of the project,
including requirements, architecture, and risk assessments. The benefits of Google Drive
over alternatives like Dropbox or OneDrive include:
-  Collaboration: Real-time file sharing and editing allow multiple users to work
        simultaneously, essential for Agile workflows.
     ●  Organisation: Google Drive’s folder system provided structure, making it easy to
        access relevant project documents.
     ●  Accessibility: Drive is accessible across multiple platforms, enabling team members
        to access files from any device. Other alternatives, such as Dropbox, do not offer as
        seamless collaborative editing tools as Google Docs does.
     ●  Set up: We all already have access to Google Drive, and are all familiar with using
        the Google software, so it wouldn’t require us to learn how to use any new software
     ●  Tracking: On Google Drive and the related apps, you can see who updated things
        when and where, allowing us to keep track of which bits of work have been done by
        which people, to both show what works we did do, and point out what work others
        didn’t do
Dropbox and OneDrive were both good alternatives that we considered using, especially
OneDrive, due to it being a Microsoft program and so being well optimised to use the other
Microsoft programs (mainly word), but due do the accessibility and ease of setting up and
using Google Drive, we decided to go with the Google option for our project.
Game Development: The team used libGDX, a Java-based game development framework,
for the game’s development. It was selected due to its cross-platform support, specifically
working across Windows and other operating systems. Unlike Unity or Unreal, libGDX is
lightweight and designed specifically for Java developers, making it a better fit for the team's
expertise. It also provides:
     ●  Customizability: The framework offers low-level access to OpenGL for custom
        game rendering.
     ●    Flexibility: It supports 2D and 3D development without the overhead of a heavy
          game engine like Unreal, which is more suited for large-scale, graphically intensive
          projects.
Unity, while more user-friendly, adds extra overhead and licensing costs for certain features,
which makes it less appealing, and also doesn’t natively support Java to program in. Unreal
was considered too complex for the game’s needs and yet again doesn’t natively support
Java, and JMonkey was discarded due to its steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with
it and focus on the development of 3D games.
Website Hosting: The team hosted the project website on GitHub, taking advantage of
GitHub Pages, which allows the hosting of static websites directly from a repository. The
main benefits of GitHub for the team included:
     ●    Version Control: Git allows team members to track changes, make commits, and
          use pull requests to propose modifications. This ensures that everyone works on the
          most updated version and reduces the risk of conflicting changes.
     ●    Collaboration: A shared repository ensures all team members can contribute, view,
          or modify the website. Other free services like GitLab offer similar version control, but
          GitHub is more widely used, ensuring broader community support.
We considered using Netlify to host our website, as Netlify has a lot of positives to it, such as
automatic deployments from Git repos, a higher level of customization, and a global Content
Delivery Network, allowing users from all around the world to be able to access it faster, but
it also has a higher learning curve to implement things, and several limitations on the free
tier, whereas GitHub would be completely free to use. As a result, we decided to use GitHub
to host our website in the end.
Assets: In this stage of the project, we decided against using assets and to just use
placeholder coloured tiles to represent each different tile or building, but we still considered
which websites we would use when it came to using assets, and the main 2 were Itch.io and
CraftPix.net. Itch.io has a decently large asset selection set, but that isn’t the website’s main
purpose, and the licensing and allowed uses of the assets you get from the website are up to
the control of the person who uploaded the assets, meaning that it’s different for each asset.
CraftPix.net however is a dedicated 2D asset marketplace, so it has a much larger catalogue
of available assets, and the licensing for them are done by CraftPix themselves, and unless
specifically stated otherwise, includes royalty-free and non-exclusive licences, meaning for
the case of our project, we wouldn’t need to worry about getting the licence to use the assets
from CraftPix in our project.
IDEs: There were a lot of different IDEs which our team considered using for the project.
The recommended IDE to use with LibGDX is Android Studio, however, due to none of our
team having ever used it, we decided against using it, and instead debated over whether to
use VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA. VS Code was more lightweight and customizable, however it
doesn’t natively support Java. IntelliJ IDEA however is designed for Java development and
is at default a full featured IDE, and multiple members of our team were already familiar with
IntelliJ IDEA, so the decision seemed easy to make between which IDE we would use.
Although you can use multiple different IDEs simultaneously and there won’t be any outright
compatibility issues, we decided to all use the same IDEs to avoid any confusion and
clashes with different Java versions or unavailable functions, and so we all decided to use
IntelliJ IDEA as our IDE.
Team Organization Approach
The team adopted a hierarchical structure with a designated leader, Jacob. His role involved
making sure we don't get sidetracked and helping ensure meaningful progression. This
leadership structure was effective for the team for several reasons such as acting as a
central point of contact, distributing work and ensuring that no one was overwhelmed.
In addition to appointing Jacob as the team leader, the roles were clearly divided to
streamline the workflow and maximise efficiency. Each team member took responsibility for
specific aspects of the project:
    ●   Hasan and Isaac handled risk management, analysing potential project risks and
        preparing mitigation strategies. Their work was vital for ensuring that issues such as
        delays, technical hurdles, or resource limitations were anticipated early and
        addressed.
    ●   Alex and Hasan were tasked with game architecture. They designed the underlying
        structure of the game, ensuring it was scalable, efficient, and adaptable for future
        changes. This task involved defining core components such as game logic, graphics
        systems, and input handling.
    ●   Huzaifa took charge of the website development and method selection and
        planning. He was responsible for hosting the project on GitHub and ensuring that it
        was easily accessible to the client and team. His role in method selection helped
        define the Agile approach that guided the team’s workflow..
    ●   Jacob and Joe worked on the requirements gathering, ensuring that all client
        expectations were clearly understood and documented. They translated the client's
        vision into concrete game features and deliverables.
Parallel Development and Team Coordination: While each member focused on their
individual roles, they worked in parallel to ensure that no time was wasted. For example, as
Hasan and Isaac worked on risk management, the others progressed with their tasks. The
deadlines were staggered to allow for dependencies, such as the architecture deadline
preceding the start of the full implementation and as certain people members were free they
helped with the others tasks.
The team's approach was appropriate for both the project and team because it:
    ●   Allowed each member to focus on their area of expertise, maximising output quality.
    ●   Facilitated early detection of problems in risk management, enabling timely
        adjustments.
    ●   Ensured smooth handoffs between phases, particularly between architecture and
        implementation.
The team held two meetings per week to review progress, resolve challenges, and
brainstorm improvements. These regular meetings were essential for:
    ●   Transparency: Ensuring everyone was on the same page and that all aspects of the
        project were progressing in sync.
    ●   Flexibility: Early identification of potential blockers allowed the team to shift priorities
        and adapt quickly.
This organisation method was appropriate for both the project and team because it
emphasised collaboration, task division, and continuous feedback, all of which were
necessary for timely delivery.
Project Plan
The project was divided into key tasks, each with its own timeline, priority, and
dependencies:
1. Website Development (Huzaifa)
    ●  Start Date: October 1
    ●  End Date: October 17
    ●  Priority: High
    ●  Huzaifa worked on the project website, hosted on GitHub, and he ensured the
       website was up-to-date with the project timeline
2. Requirements Gathering (Jacob and Joe)
    ●  Start Date: October 1
    ●  End Date: October 20
    ●  Priority: High
    ●  Dependency: None
       This phase focused on gathering and documenting the game’s functional and
       non-functional requirements, ensuring alignment with the client's needs.
3. Risk Management (Hasan and Isaac)
    ●  Start Date: October 3
    ●  End Date: October 10
    ●  Priority: Medium
    ●  Dependency: None
       Hassan and Isaac identified potential risks (technical, resource-related) and devised
       mitigation strategies.
4. Game Architecture Design (Charlie and Alex)
    ●  Start Date: October 5
    ●  End Date: October 24
    ●  Priority: High
    ●  Dependency: Requirements must be clear before architecture design begins.
       This task involved defining the game’s structural components, including class
       hierarchies, game mechanics, and system interactions.
5. Method Selection and Planning (Huzaifa)
    ●  Start Date: October 5
    ●  End Date: October 17
    ●  Priority: Medium
    ●  Dependency: None
       Huzaifa convened with the team which selected the Agile method for coordination.
6. Full Game Implementation (All Team Members)
     ●   Start Date: October 25
     ●   End Date: Before client’s final deadline
     ●   Priority: High
     ●   Dependency: Completion of the architecture design
         Once Charlie and Alex completed the architecture, the team began full
         implementation, working in parallel on different game components such as gameplay
         logic, graphics integration, and testing.
Gantt Chart (Isaac)
The above Gantt Chart is a visual representation of our plan, the start and end dates for
each process, and the connections between them. The main links are between the
requirements and the architecture, as the architecture required the requirements to be
complete in order for it to be undertaken. This was not however realised at the beginning, as
the previous plan stated, as we assumed that the architecture could be made before the
completion of the requirements, however, when we came to understand that requirements
must be done before the architecture could be begun, we changed our plan to accommodate
for this.
         The requirements and architecture have been split up in this Gantt Chart in order to
highlight that some parts of the architecture could be completed without the full set of
requirements being done, but the overall critical path of the project required all the
requirements to be completed, with the user and functional requirements being more so
important to be completed first, as the process of developing the architecture relied on them
being done in order for them to be undertaken.
         The risk assessment and planning, alongside the risk management, were not
members of the critical path, as even though they are crucial to the completion of the project,
no other part of the project relied on them being completed before it could be done, as a
result, they were only put on medium priority (as shown by being shades of green), whereas
everything else was critical to being completed, as they are being shown in shades of purple
and red. The website may not have had anything else hinging on its completion along the
critical path, but due to the nature of the project requiring everything to be displayed through
the website, it was of utmost importance that it was completed as well, thus we put it on High
priority too.
